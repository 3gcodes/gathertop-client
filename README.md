gathertop-client
================

I'm attempting to learn AngularJS so I created a simple project called GatherTop.

GatherTop is a simple Tabletop event scheduler.  Currently, this is a client only
application and even though it uses $http it is requesting local json files for static data.

At some point, a server side project will be added and I'll probably use it to learn something cool
like vert.x (or something).
